#### 1. Network hardening measures
Implement controls to stop threats at the network level.
1.   Network discovery hardening – Block network exploration protocols.
 – Close unused ports. 
 – Maintain an accurate and up-to-date asset inventory that identifies the list of the devices that are allowed on your network.
2.  etwork security architecture hardening
    – Use firewalls.
    – Use an intrusion prevention system (IPS).
    – Segment your network

   #####  Systems hardening measures
Implement controls to stop threats at the host level.

Hosts include workstations, servers, or other devices that run services and applications or store data.
1.  Apply operating system (OS) patches and security updates regularly.
2.  Remove unused applications and services.
3.  Monitor and control configuration change

#### 3. Data security controls Implement controls to protect the data.
Example measures: 
1.   Encrypt data in transit and data at rest as needed.
2. Use digital certificates to protect information.
3.   Use data integrity checking tools. • Use role-based access control.

#### 4. Identity management
Implement controls for user authentication and authorization.
1.  Use the principle of least privilege to control access to resources.
Information
2.   Set up a policy that enforces password strength and password expiration.
3.   Use the principles of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).
